CS 193P iPhone Application Development
======================================
Course from Stanford 2012-2013 (Winter 2013)
By Paul Hegarty

Assignments 1 - 3 in Matchismo 
--- 
Assignments 4 - 6 in SPot
---
Done all extra tasks in all 6 assignments.

One of the best courses i have ever seen)

My environment:
--------------
Windows -> VirtualBox-> MacOS with Xcode Version 4.6.3 (4H1503)
So it can probably crash or don't work on real macs/iphones/ipods or updated OS/Xcode versions

It was realy a pain to code under virtual machine, but worth it in the end.
